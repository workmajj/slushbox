Description
-----------

When building static web pages, you need to reload them often to see your changes. [Slushbox](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slushbox) opens web pages and then refreshes them automatically when files in their respective directories (or subdirectories) change. So if you edit a CSS file, for example, Slushbox will notice and refresh accordingly.

Slushbox also works with arbitrary URLs. This addresses situations where a web framework is handling your URL routing or you're working in a server-hosted dev environment. Slushbox runs as long as the initial URL can be pattern-matched in the browser bar, so you can even navigate to subpages.

At this point, Slushbox has a couple known (and probably some unknown!) limitations:

* Runs only under Mac OS X, since it uses AppleScript for browser control.

* Currently works only with Google Chrome (not yet tested with Safari, and Firefox has minimal AppleScript support).

Running on OS X 10.7 Lion
-------------------------

Slushbox relies on the [MacFSEvents](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MacFSEvents) library, which will be installed automatically if you use ```pip```. Parts of MacFSEvents are written in C and will not compile under XCode 4.2. If you want to install Slushbox on Lion, first tell OS X to use ```gcc``` instead of ```llvm-gcc``` (which is the new default on XCode 4.2):

    $ CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.2

This will ensure that MacFSEvents compiles correctly when Slushbox installs it.

If you don't have the gcc-4.2 binary on your system, you can get it by installing [Xcode 4.1](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/download.action?path=Developer_Tools/xcode_4.1_for_lion/xcode_4.1_for_lion.dmg) or by using [osx-gcc-installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer).

Testing & Usage
---------------

1. Install Slushbox from [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Slushbox). If you have [```pip```](http://guide.python-distribute.org/installation.html) on your system, you can do:

        $ sudo pip install slushbox

2. Next, create a temporary directory. In that directory, make an HTML file called ```test.html``` with these contents:

        <p>Lorem ipsum blah blah blah.</p>

3. Run Slushbox in that directory, telling it to open the file and watch the directory (and any subdirectories) for changes:

        $ slushbox test.html

4. At this point, Chrome should open if it's not already running, and the page will load in a new tab.

5. Now use a text editor to modify ```test.html```. Slushbox will reload the page in Chrome when you save. You can also try adding or deleting files in the directory, or creating and modifying subdirectories. While the page is open, you can even navigate to other linked files.

6. When you're finished, close the browser tab Slushbox originally opened; the command-line program will quit automatically.

7. Slushbox can also refresh arbitrary URLs, which is handy for working with web frameworks or remote dev environments:

        $ mkdir random-directory
        $ slushbox random-directory https://github.com/workmajj/slushbox

8. Now when you modify the contents of ```random-directory```, Chrome will reload that GitHub page (or the current page if you've navigated away).
